# baylor-thesis-template-edp
This repository holds the basic LaTex template that formats Baylor University's master thesis/doctoral dissertations.
The code is note fully generalizably to all departments as of yet.

## How to use the LaTex template
The specifics for how to compile the document will vary slightly depending on the editor used.
However, generally, the process is all follows.

1. Open the BaylorThesisExample.tex file,
2. Run the file by using Latex, Latex, BibLatex, Latex, View, (or fn + F1 for quick compile),
3. This will display the final pdf version of the thesis.

One major benefit of this formatting is that is allows for the thesis to be broken up into more management files by chapter, appendix, and references. 
The list of files is larger than if you used Word, but the formatting is easy on the backend (IMO). 


## To do list

1. Make department function for the main file so that we don't have to edit the .cls file for each department.
2. Merge the two .cls files so we don't need one for masters and one for phd (it's currently only a few lines differences anyways...)
